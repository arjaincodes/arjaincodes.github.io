									<h1>Cyrptocurrencies:<br />
									Bitcoin</h1>
									<p>You've probably heard of cryptocurrencies, the digital alternative to dollars and euros that have dominated the news for the past decade. Their total market worth increased from zero to over $2 trillion throughout that time. So, what's the explanation behind their meteoric rise?

										It's simple: they provide something that traditional currencies, such as dollars, do not. For starters, they are more transparent and democratic. They also provide you extraordinary freedom over how you spend, invest, and buy. Most crucially, governments and central banks have no authority over them, even though they'll try to ban it.
										
										Over the coming weeks, I'll write about everything I've learnt in the last 5 years about them. We'll talk about Ethereum, decentralized finance, NFTs and much more.</p>

								<p><h2>How did the need arise for something like Bitcoin?</h2>

									<p>Money is a medium of exchange, but it has many other functions. Economists also point out a second feature: it is a store of value, which means that its value is retained over time.</p>
									
									<p>However, if you look back over monetary history, you'll notice that this second trait is more typical in principle than in fact. In fact, the value of money is prone to fluctuation. One answer to this dilemma is to centralize money control, allowing governments and banks to affect its value.</p>
									
									<p>Regrettably, governments and banks frequently abuse their power. What's the end result? The currencies they control are depreciating in value. If a government runs out of money but has control over the supply, it may simply smelt new coins or print new bills. Inflation, defined as an increase in prices and a decrease in purchasing power, is the result of this. The more cash floating about the market, the lower the currency's value, meaning you'll need more of it to buy things.</p>
									
									<p>Inflation isn't entirely awful in tiny doses. When consumers perceive that prices are rising, they are more likely to purchase large items such as cars immediately rather than tomorrow, when they will be even more expensive. This has the potential to benefit the economy. Inflation, on the other hand, wipes out savings and lowers investment. Households have less money to spend, and investment yields are too low to justify the risk, resulting in stagnation.</p>
									
									<p>That's exactly what happened in China in the fifteenth century, when the country became the first to use paper money. The government issued fresh bills whenever it needed money. It had to ditch paper money because its currency had depreciated to the point where notes were only worth 0.014 percent of their face value.</p>
									
									<p>Banks can also increase the money supply by issuing credit, loans, and mortgages; however, this approach can be just as harmful as governments creating money.</p>
									
									<p>Consider the Great Depression, which was triggered in large part by banksâ€™ lending more money than they had on hand. When the stock market fell, worried depositors attempted to withdraw their funds. This resulted in a bank run, in which large-scale withdrawals deplete a bank's cash reserves, causing it to fail. Around 9,000 banks failed between 1929 and the mid-1930s, losing American depositors an estimated $140 billion.</p>
									
									So, what is the other option? To put it another way, to reimagine the gold standard for the digital age. Enter <b>Bitcoin</b>.</p>
