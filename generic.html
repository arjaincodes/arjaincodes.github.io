									<h1>Cyrptocurrencies:<br />
									Bitcoin</h1>
									<p>You've probably heard of cryptocurrencies, the digital alternative to dollars and euros that have dominated the news for the past decade. Their total market worth increased from zero to over $2 trillion throughout that time. So, what's the explanation behind their meteoric rise?

										It's simple: they provide something that traditional currencies, such as dollars, do not. For starters, they are more transparent and democratic. They also provide you extraordinary freedom over how you spend, invest, and buy. Most crucially, governments and central banks have no authority over them, even though they'll try to ban it.
										
										Over the coming weeks, I'll write about everything I've learnt in the last 5 years about them. We'll talk about Ethereum, decentralized finance, NFTs and much more.</p>

								<p><h2>How did the need arise for something like Bitcoin?</h2>

									<p>Money is a medium of exchange, but it has many other functions. Economists also point out a second feature: it is a store of value, which means that its value is retained over time.</p>
									
									<p>However, if you look back over monetary history, you'll notice that this second trait is more typical in principle than in fact. In fact, the value of money is prone to fluctuation. One answer to this dilemma is to centralize money control, allowing governments and banks to affect its value.</p>
									
									<p>Regrettably, governments and banks frequently abuse their power. What's the end result? The currencies they control are depreciating in value. If a government runs out of money but has control over the supply, it may simply smelt new coins or print new bills. Inflation, defined as an increase in prices and a decrease in purchasing power, is the result of this. The more cash floating about the market, the lower the currency's value, meaning you'll need more of it to buy things.</p>
									
									<p>Inflation isn't entirely awful in tiny doses. When consumers perceive that prices are rising, they are more likely to purchase large items such as cars immediately rather than tomorrow, when they will be even more expensive. This has the potential to benefit the economy. Inflation, on the other hand, wipes out savings and lowers investment. Households have less money to spend, and investment yields are too low to justify the risk, resulting in stagnation.</p>
									
									<p>That's exactly what happened in China in the fifteenth century, when the country became the first to use paper money. The government issued fresh bills whenever it needed money. It had to ditch paper money because its currency had depreciated to the point where notes were only worth 0.014 percent of their face value.</p>
									
									<p>Banks can also increase the money supply by issuing credit, loans, and mortgages; however, this approach can be just as harmful as governments creating money.</p>
									
									<p>Consider the Great Depression, which was triggered in large part by banks’ lending more money than they had on hand. When the stock market fell, worried depositors attempted to withdraw their funds. This resulted in a bank run, in which large-scale withdrawals deplete a bank's cash reserves, causing it to fail. Around 9,000 banks failed between 1929 and the mid-1930s, losing American depositors an estimated $140 billion.</p>
									
									So, what is the other option? To put it another way, to reimagine the gold standard for the digital age. Enter <b>Bitcoin</b>.</p>

									<p></p><h2>The role of Bitcoin in a 4-asset portfolio</h2>
									<p>Bitcoin (BTC), the most prominent cryptocurrency, has evolved from a niche initiative for tech-savvy individuals to a mainstream investment tool. With the advent of simple-to-use wallets and ETFs, a wide range of investors - from tiny retail speculators to huge institutional investors - may now participate in Bitcoin. As an investment business, we will consider if a Bitcoin allocation may boost the performance of our fund.

										This analysis will examine Bitcoin's and Tesla's performance since 2014, as well as the two other key asset classes in our fund, US stocks and gold, to assist in answering this issue. In doing so, we shall address many issues:</p>
									<ul><li>How does the performance of Bitcoin (i.e. risk and returns) compare to that of Tesla, the S&P 500 and gold?</li>
									<li>How does the inclusion of Bitcoin change a portfolio's characteristics and can it help improve a portfolio's performance?</li>
									<li>Could Bitcoin be used as a hedge against inflation?</li>
									<li>In the light of our fund's goal to minimize risk: What is the minimum volatility portfolio, consisting of these four asset classes? And for comparison: Which portfolio would maximize risk-adjusted returns?</li></ul>
									<p>A word of caution: this study is totally retrospective, based on historical performance data. That's useful information for answering the questions above. However, it should not be simply generalised into the future. The data observation period (2014-2021) is quite short, potentially not capturing the whole business cycle. Throughout the most of this time, inflation has been rather modest. Meanwhile, the time period represents the early stages of Bitcoin becoming a popular investment and generating massive investor inflows. Future behaviour may differ dramatically. As a result, before making a final investment decision, we recommend supplementing these results with further forward-looking analyses.</p>

									<div class="box">
										<p><b>Figure 1</b> shows strong outperformance of Bitcoin and Tesla over the observation period. From September 2014 until June 2022, <b>Bitcoin (+76.63% p.a.)</b> and <b>Tesla (+42.57% p.a.)</b> massively outperformed both <b>gold (+5.3% p.a.)</b> and the <b>S&P 500 (10.01% p.a.)</b>. Over the entire period Bitcoin's value increased by a factor of roughly <b>160x</b> (at peak) and Tesla's value increased by a factor of roughly <b>24x</b> (at peak), compared to <b>2.4x</b> (at peak) for the S&P 500 and <b>1.7x</b> (at peak) for gold. Today, on 22nnd June 2022, after falling 75% from its peak in November 2021, bitcoin price is still 82x compared to its 2014 price. Similarly, Tesla is 15x, S&P is 2.1x, and is Gold 1.5x

										<p><b>Figure 2</b> depicts Bitcoin's increasing popularity based on trading volume. While trading activity for S&P 500 equities has remained relatively consistent over the period, it has increased dramatically for Bitcoin. Until late in 2017, daily S&P 500 trading volumes outpaced Bitcoin's. Since then, Bitcoin trading volume has consistently exceeded that of the S&P 500, and by a significant margin recently (e.g. by a factor of 12.5x so far in 2021 on average: 50bn Bitcoins vs. 4bn S&P 500 shares). <b>Caution:</b> The Bitcoin trade volume appears to be excessively large; data should be validated before being utilised for further study.
